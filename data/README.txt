
"She Was A Visitor" is a vocal piece written by Robert Ashley in 1967. It is based completely on speech and is performed by one single speaker and number of singers that are divided in chorus groups. This recreation is an attempt to model the chorus digitally using Max, allowing a computer to perform the piece on its own or interactively.
